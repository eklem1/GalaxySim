# GalaxySim

**GalaxyHOD.py**: The basis for a new ARES class with a LF and SMF model based off the work below, as well as main sequence SFR, SSFR and SFRD models.

**WorkingFromHalo.ipynb**: Looking a simplified relation of the HMF to LF as well as to SMF.   
**HMFtoSMF_nonLinear.ipynb**: Starting from Moster2010 paper, a DPL relation of HMF to SMF.  
**SFRs.ipynb**: Starting from Speagle2014 paper, main sequence SFR, SSFR and SFRD.  
 
**DataCompile.ipynb**: Script to read and format data from "behroozi-2013-data-compilation" for more SMF lit values.

Working with Ares (see docs at https://ares.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
